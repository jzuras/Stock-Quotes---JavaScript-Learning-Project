This is a learning project for myself, and it is not expected to be useful 
to the world at large.

I am in the process of getting back into the coding field after some time away,
so rather than just re-hash my old C# skills, I thought I would catch up on
what's been happening with JavaScript.

I am starting with this project, in JavaScript, before eventually moving it to
TypeScript. (I will likely create a separate Repo for that version.)

The concept of the project is to pull stock quotes, displaying static quotes
in a chart, with the ability to ask for periodic refreshes. The user can also
ask for a chart of the quotes for the current day, from the opening bell to
the current time. (Future enhancements could be to handle this for days that
the market is closed.)

I am using TwelveData for the quotes, and the free version does not seem to
be updated as often as sites like Yahoo Finance (quotes do not change quickly).
There is also a monthly limit, as well as a limit of 8 quotes per minute, so
the refresh code only updates a quote every thirty seconds, and for just 3 times.

Since publishing the api key on GitHub is not a good idea, the user is asked for
this information. Once this is running on GitHub Pages, I can provide that info
for any recruiters that might want to try it out. There is also a new TS version
that uses my Azure Function and does not require the api key.
